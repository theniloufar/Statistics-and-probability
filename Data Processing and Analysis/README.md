# Project: Python Script Collection for Data Processing and Analysis

This project comprises a series of Python scripts designed to perform various data processing and analysis tasks. Each script implements a different aspect of the overall project, with functionality described in the accompanying report.

## Project Structure

- **Python Scripts:**
  - `1.py`: Implements functionality related to [describe functionality].
  - `2.py`: Handles tasks related to [describe functionality].
  - `3.py`: Performs operations involving [describe functionality].
  - `4.py`: Completes the task of [describe functionality].
  - `tempCodeRunnerFile.py`: A temporary file generated for testing purposes.

- **Documentation:**
  - `report.pdf`: A report detailing the design, methodology, and results of the project.

## Installation

To run the scripts in this project, you need Python installed on your machine along with any required libraries. You can install necessary dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Note: If there is no `requirements.txt` file, manually check and install any needed packages listed in the script files.*

## Usage

1. **Prepare the Environment:**
   - Ensure all scripts are in the same directory and the required Python environment is set up.

2. **Execute the Scripts:**
   - Run each script as needed. For example:
   ```bash
   python 1.py
   ```

3. **View Outputs:**
   - Outputs and results are printed to the console or saved to files as specified in the scripts.

## Key Concepts

- **[Concept 1]:** Explanation of a key concept or methodology used in the scripts.
- **[Concept 2]:** Explanation of another important concept or approach taken in the project.
