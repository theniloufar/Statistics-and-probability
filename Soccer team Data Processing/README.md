# Project: Data Processing and Analysis with Python

This project involves the implementation of data processing and analysis tasks using Python. It includes scripts for processing datasets, utilizing trained models, and generating insights. The project uses a dataset from FIFA2020 and includes an autoencoder model for potential data analysis.

## Project Structure

- **Python Scripts:**
  - `1.py`: Implements functionality related to [describe functionality].
  - `2.py`: Handles tasks related to [describe functionality].
  - `3.py`: Performs operations involving [describe functionality].
  - `tempCodeRunnerFile.py`: A temporary file generated for testing purposes.

- **Data and Model Files:**
  - `FIFA2020.csv`: Dataset file for analysis.
  - `mnist_AE.h5`: Pre-trained autoencoder model for data processing.

- **Documentation:**
  - `EPS-CA3-REPORTSHEET.pdf`: A report detailing the design, methodology, and results of the project.

## Installation

To run the scripts in this project, you need Python installed on your machine along with any required libraries. You can install necessary dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Note: If there is no `requirements.txt` file, manually check and install any needed packages listed in the script files.*

## Usage

1. **Prepare the Environment:**
   - Ensure all scripts and data files are in the same directory, and the required Python environment is set up.

2. **Execute the Scripts:**
   - Run each script as needed. For example:
   ```bash
   python 1.py
   ```

3. **View Outputs:**
   - Outputs and results are printed to the console or saved to files as specified in the scripts.

## Key Concepts

- **Autoencoders:** Utilized for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction.
- **Data Processing:** Techniques for cleaning and transforming data for analysis.
